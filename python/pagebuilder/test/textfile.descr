Britain and Europe ‘Sleepwalked’ Into the Ukraine Crisis, Report Says

LONDON — Britain and the European Union made a “catastrophic misreading” of Russia and President Vladimir V. Putin and “sleepwalked” into the Ukraine crisis, treating it as a trade issue rather than as a delicate foreign-policy challenge, British lawmakers said Friday in a scathing report.
For too long, the European Union’s relationship with Moscow had been predicated on the “optimistic premise” that Russia was becoming a democratic, law-abiding country, the report said, rendering member nations insensitive to the degree of Russian hostility toward European Union efforts to negotiate a closer political and economic relationship, known as an “association agreement,” with Ukraine.
European states “have been slow to reappraise the relationship and to adapt to the realities of the Russia we have today,” the report said, and lack a long-term strategic response.
The analytical failure and “glaring absence of political oversight” was compounded by a decline in Russia expertise and analysis in Britain and across the European Union, the report said.
“A loss of collective analytical capacity has weakened member states’ ability to read the political shifts in Russia and to offer an authoritative response,” it said.
The report concluded that the European Union had failed to appreciate “the exceptional nature” of Ukraine and its relationship to a more aggressive Russia in Mr. Putin’s latest term as president.
Britain failed to live up to its obligations in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which it signed with Russia, the United States and Ukraine, guaranteeing Ukraine’s territorial integrity and offering security “assurances” in return for Kiev’s renouncing its extensive nuclear arsenal, the report said.
“The U.K. had a particular responsibility towards the country, and it has not been as active or as visible as it could have been,” it said.
While the policy of the United States was not a direct topic for the report, the same criticism was implicit. Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Russia, said that the “misreading” of Ukraine applied to the United States as well as to Europe.
The report was prepared over nine months by the European Union external affairs subcommittee of the House of Lords and overseen by Christopher Tugendhat, a former member of the European Commission.
The report sharply criticizes Russia and the pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, and it recommends further Western economic sanctions in response to the fighting, which has continued despite another cease-fire.
Further European sanctions should follow Washington’s practice of targeting those close to Mr. Putin as opposed to middle-ranking officials in Crimea, the report said, and the European Union should consider extending sanctions into the Russian financial sector.
Britain, it said, should stage an international donor conference in London for Ukraine. A Foreign Office official said that no one could have predicted the Russian intervention in eastern Ukraine.
