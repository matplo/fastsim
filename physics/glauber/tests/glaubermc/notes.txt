1. within the tree the collisions have:
- number of nucleon A and B
- energy of nucleon A and B

2. loop over collisions:
- keep list of nucleon A and nucleon B
- for each collision 
-- use the nA and nB to identify the nucleons
-- generate a pythia event with eA and eB
-- modify the nucleon eA and eB post collision
